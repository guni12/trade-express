# trade-express

trade-express is a backend server providing secure login services for a trading platform. It is built on Express.js, which is a flexible web application framework. Node.js allows for javascript to run server-side scripts and is the very foundation.

Express was created by TJ Holowaychuk with the intention to be light and easy to expand with various plugins. All is also opensource. Express is part of the MEAN stack and highly regarded by developers for its simplicity, extensibility and performance. With only one language, javascript, developers can this way become full-stack.

When PayPal moved from Java to Node.js the average response time was decreased by 35% for the same page [(ref)](https://apiko.com/blog/express-mobile-app-development/).

In `package.json` various plugins collected from node-modules can be spotted.

| Plugin | USED FOR |
| ------ | ------ |
| sqlite3 | Database for saving members id, email and password |
| bcrypt | Easy system to hash and compare passwords |
| cors | Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) requests |
| http-errors | Help create nice error-messages for 4xx and 5xx status codes |
| jsonwebtoken | Adds security to the login-process with crypting a secret key together with payload and creating a token, lasting for a certain amount of time |
| morgan | Great for debugging information during development, generates logs automatically |

The `devDependencies` plugins are there for testing and improvement of the code status during development. `eslint` identifies mistakes in codepatterns. From `javascript-style-guide` we collect the eslint configuration-file. `mocha` is a convenient and easy to use test framework. With `chai` and `chai-http` asserts and http-requests are added. Istanbul `nyc` is a command-line-client that reports the test-result as a table. Together with `coveralls` and `codecov` it will be a part of your continuous-integration flow via Travis.

**trade-express together with socket and frontend**

This platform was created (together with [trade-socket](https://github.com/guni12/trade-socket) and [trade-vue](https://github.com/guni12/trade-vue)) as my final project at [Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola](https://www.bth.se/eng/) for the course Ramverk2. The real-time application microserver keeps track of prices and assets for each member, and the frontend application creates the visual experience containing charts.
